    <h1>The Best Movies According to Kaushal</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Lagaan</h3>
    <p>
      This is my favourite movie, plotted in the time British ruling over Indian
      because its related to cricket and a competition between the Indian
      villagers and English Men for cutting of 3 years of tax, and if villagers
      lose they have to pay 3 times tax.

    <h3>The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind</h3>
    <p>
      This is a real story of a boy from an African villager where they suffer
      from water scarcity, due to which they cannot grow crops. In there village
      a tubewell is there but water is present very deep down and as there is no
      electricity they cannot use motor to pull out the water. Some how the boy
      learns about wind energy and managed to make a wind mill with his father's
      bicycle and it worked and they managed to supply water to the crops.
